_Cameras have been essential parts of portable devices, such as smartphones and tablets.
Most people have a smartphone and can take pictures anywhere, anytime to record their lives.
However, these pictures captured by cameras may suffer from noise contamination, causing issues for
subsequent image analysis, such as image recognition, object tracking, and classification of an object in
the image. This paper develops an effective combinational denoising framework based on proposed
Adaptive and Overlapped Average Filtering (AOAF) and Mixed-pooling Attention Refinement
Networks (MARNs). First, we apply AOAF to the noisy input image to obtain a preliminarily
denoised result, where noisy pixels are removed and recovered. Next, MARNs take the preliminary
result as the input and output a refined image where details and edges are better reconstructed.
The experimental results demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art
denoising methods._
